This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  This often happens when dealing with asynchronous operations where data hasn't yet loaded.  Consider the following code example where `data` is fetched asynchronously:

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  state = {
    data: null,
  };

  async componentDidMount() {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    this.setState({ data });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>{this.state.data.name}</Text> {/* Error occurs here if data is null */}
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```

Before the asynchronous fetch completes, `this.state.data` will be `null`, leading to a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')` when rendering.
